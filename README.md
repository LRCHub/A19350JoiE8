[00:15.09] Why do you build me up? (Build me up)
[00:17.84] Buttercup baby, just to let me down (let me down)
[00:21.69] And mess me around and then worst of all (worst of all)
[00:25.15] You never call baby when you say you will (say you will)
[00:28.65] But I love you still, I need you (I need you)
[00:31.69] More than anyone, darlin'
[00:33.10] You know that I have from the start
[00:37.06] So build me up (build me up)
[00:39.44] Buttercup, don't break my heart
[00:54.94] 
[00:44.61] "I'll be over at ten", you told me time and again
[00:47.93] But you're late, I waited around and then (bah-dah-dah)
[00:52.06] I run to the door, I can't take any more
[00:54.95] It's not you, you let me down again (hey, hey, hey!)
[01:20.95] 
[00:59.56] Baby, baby, try to find (hey, hey, hey!)
[01:02.90] A little time and I'll make you happy (hey, hey, hey!)
[01:06.27] I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone waiting for you
[01:11.40] Ooh-oo-ooh, ooh-oo-ooh
[01:22.40] 
[01:15.39] Why do you build me up? (Build me up)

[01:22.08] And mess me around and then worst of all (worst of all)
[01:25.68] You never call baby when you say you will (say you will)
[01:29.02] But I love you still, I need you (I need you)
[01:32.42] More than anyone, darlin'

[01:37.87] So build me up (build me up)
[01:40.14] Buttercup, don't break my heart
[01:55.64] 
[01:44.86] To you I'm a toy, but I could be the boy you adore
[01:50.41] If you'd just let me know (bah-dah-dah)
[01:52.77] Although you're untrue, I'm attracted to you all the more
[01:57.59] Why do I need you so? (Hey, hey, hey!)
[02:16.59] 
[02:00.27] Baby, baby, try to find (hey, hey, hey!)
[02:03.55] A little time and I'll make you happy (hey, hey, hey!)
[02:07.13] I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone waiting for you
[02:12.24] Ooh-oo-ooh, ooh-oo-ooh
